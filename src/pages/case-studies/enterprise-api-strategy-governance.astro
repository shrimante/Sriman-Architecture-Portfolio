  title: "Enterprise API Strategy & Governance",
  teaser: "Standardized the API lifecycle for a global enterprise, implementing robust security, automated quality gates, and high-fidelity observability.",
  context: `Prior to this initiative, API development was siloed across multiple teams, with inconsistent security standards and zero central governance. This led to significant security risks, duplicated efforts, and a complete lack of discoverability for existing services.

  The mission was to establish a unified API Operating Model that could support 120+ production APIs while maintaining strict security compliance and governance.`,
  mandate: `My mandate involved:
  - Defining global API Standards and Security Policies (OAuth2, TLS, RBAC).
  - Implementing API Manager and Exchange as the central source of truth.
  - Building an observability stack using Splunk, ELK, and Anypoint Monitoring.
  - Creating a Delivery Operating Model aligned with ART/PI planning.`,
  results: [
    "120+ Production APIs standardized",
    "ZERO security breaches since implementation",
    "90% Reduction in service duplication",
    "Enterprise-wide observability dashboard"
  ],
  differently: "I would have prioritized developer advocacy more heavily in the first phase. We focused strictly on the governance 'gates', which initially met some internal resistance. A more collaborative 'enablement' approach would have accelerated adoption and reduced the initial friction between the COE and the feature teams."

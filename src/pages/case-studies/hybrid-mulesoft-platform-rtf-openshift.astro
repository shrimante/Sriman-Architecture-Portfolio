  title: "Hybrid MuleSoft Platform: RTF on OpenShift",
  teaser: "Architected and delivered a secure, high-availability hybrid integration platform serving 5M+ members, leveraging MuleSoft Runtime Fabric (RTF) on OpenShift, F5 Big-IP, and enterprise GitLab CI/CD pipelines.",
  context: `The legacy infrastructure relied on monolithic ESB patterns, which lacked the elastic scalability needed for a rapidly growing ecosystem of 120+ microservices. Manual deployment processes and fragmented observability led to inconsistent MTTR and limited governance.

  The objective was to engineer a modern, hybrid platform combining the cost-efficiency of on-prem OpenShift with the orchestration power of MuleSoft Runtime Fabric (RTF), targeting 99.9% uptime and a significant reduction in deployment friction.`,
  mandate: `As the Technical Platform Lead, I was responsible for:
  - Designing the high-availability RTF on OpenShift architecture with F5 Big-IP for intelligent traffic management and TLS termination.
  - Engineering 100% automated GitLab CI/CD pipelines incorporating quality gates (MUnit), security scanning, and dynamic environment provisioning.
  - Establishing multi-region DR playbooks and automated secret rotation via AWS Secrets Manager.
  - Leading a cross-functional team of 15+ engineers through the migration of mission-critical member services.`,
  results: [
    "99.9% Uptime maintained during peak traffic for 5M+ members",
    "40% Reduction in deployment windows (from days to minutes)",
    "25% Operational efficiency gain via unified control plane",
    "Eliminated manual configuration errors through 100% Infrastructure-as-Code"
  ],
  differently: "In retrospect, I would have invested earlier in automated performance profiling within the CI/CD pipeline. While we hit our reliability targets, optimizing resource allocation on OpenShift became a manual overhead during peak traffic periods which could have been mitigated through automated load testing and predictive scaling."

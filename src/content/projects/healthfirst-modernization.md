### Project Overview
As an Engineering Manager at Virtusa, I led the modernization of legacy systems for HealthFirst, shifting towards a resilient microservices-based architecture.

### S - Situation
The client struggled with slow release cycles, high maintenance costs, and frequent downtime in their monolithic healthcare platform.

### T - Task
Modernize 50+ APIs and legacy integrations into a streamlined microservices architecture while automating testing and deployment pipelines.

### A - Action
- Delivered **50+ APIs** using MuleSoft and Spring Boot.
- Automated testing using **mUnit, Postman, and JMeter**, ensuring 100% regression coverage.
- Built robust **CI/CD pipelines** that reduced release cycles from weeks to days.
- Established **Observability Dashboards** for real-time monitoring and alerting.

### R - Result
- **40% reduction in release cycles**.
- Significant improvement in system uptime and reliability.
- Successfully mentored a team of MuleSoft engineers in modern architectural patterns.

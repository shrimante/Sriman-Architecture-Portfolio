### Project Overview
As a Technical Consultant at Daon India, I contributed to the security and interoperability of the UIDAI (Aadhaar) project, one of the world's largest biometric identity systems.

### S - Situation
The national identity project required a highly secure, standards-based way for various systems to authenticate users and manage access.

### T - Task
Implement **Single Sign-On (SSO)** functionality conforming to **OpenID Connect and OAuth** standards, while building diagnostic tools for performance monitoring.

### A - Action
- Developed SSO modules using **Java, Spring, and Hibernate**.
- Created custom diagnostic utilities: **BQA, GREP-TOOL, and BDT** for Linux.
- Built a **Load Testing Suite** using SOAP-UI scripts for high-volume verification.
- Acted as a technical liaison between global teams to ensure security alignment.

### R - Result
- Successfully deployed secure authentication layers for national-scale usage.
- Improved diagnostic capabilities, reducing troubleshooting time for production issues.
- Established rigorous load testing standards for identity services.

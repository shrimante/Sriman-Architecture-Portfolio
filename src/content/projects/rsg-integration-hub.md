### Project Overview
The RSG Core Integration Hub was designed to modernize legacy integration patterns into a resilient, high-throughput ecosystem. 

### S - Situation
The client faced extreme fragmentation across 7+ business units with no centralized API governance or observability.

### T - Task
Architect a unified integration hub that supports both cloud-native and on-premise workloads while enforcing strict security standards.

### A - Action
- Implemented **MuleSoft CloudHub 2.0 and Runtime Fabric (RTF)** on AWS.
- Leveraged **Solace PubSub+** for high-performance event-driven architecture.
- Built custom **Shared Libraries** for standardized error handling and logging.
- Established comprehensive observability using **Anypoint Monitoring, Splunk, and ELK Stack**.

### R - Result
- Delivered **120+ production APIs** with 99.99% uptime.
- Reduced integration development time by **35%** through reusable patterns and RFP-aligned solutioning.
- Successfully migrated legacy TIBCO and IBM ESB platforms to the unified MuleSoft ecosystem.

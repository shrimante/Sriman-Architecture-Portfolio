### Project Overview
As the Principal Architect, I spearheaded the transition from fragmented legacy integrations to a high-throughput, unified ecosystem enabling cross-functional agility for 7+ business units.

### S - Situation
The enterprise faced extreme architectural fragmentation, hindering business speed and leaving the organization without centralized governance or observability.

### T - Task
Design and implement a resilient, national-scale integration hub supporting cloud-native and on-premise workloads while enforcing rigid security and performance standards.

### A - Action
- Engineered the core platform using **MuleSoft CloudHub 2.0 and Runtime Fabric (RTF)**.
- Established **Solace PubSub+** as the event backbone for high-performance, asynchronous workflows.
- Developed a suite of **Shared Architectural Libraries** to standardize security, logging, and error handling.
- Implemented global observability via **Anypoint Monitoring, Splunk, and ELK**.

### R - Result
- Delivered **120+ production APIs** with 99.99% operational uptime.
- Accelerated development velocity by **35%** through reusable patterns.
- Successfully decommissioned high-cost legacy TIBCO and IBM ESB environments.

### Project Overview
I architected a Generative AI orchestration layer to modernize traditional quality engineering, moving from manual verification to intelligent, agentic workflows.

### S - Situation
Engineering productivity was capped by legacy, manual testing cycles and slow root-cause analysis (RCA) feedback loops.

### T - Task
Implement an AI-driven delivery accelerator using modern LLM frameworks to automate the synthesis of architectural intent into executable quality safeguards.

### A - Action
- Designed a custom AI orchestrator using **LangChain** and **OpenAI/Anthropic** models.
- Built a **Semantic Knowledge Base** using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over internal architectural docs.
- Developed automated **Agentic Workflows** that synthesize test strategies directly from documentation.

### R - Result
- Slashed manual test creation time by **25%**.
- Improved production defect detection by **18%** through AI-assisted RCA.
- Established a scalable blueprint for the transition to the **Agentic Enterprise**.

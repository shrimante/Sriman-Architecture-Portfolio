### Project Overview
This project focused on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into the core engineering lifecycle to reduce manual overhead and improve quality assurance.

### S - Situation
Delivery cycles were being slowed down by traditional, manual quality engineering processes and slow feedback loops.

### T - Task
Implement an AI-driven modernization layer using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate test generation and root cause analysis.

### A - Action
- Developed an AI orchestrator using **LangChain** and **OpenAI**.
- Built a **Semantic Search** layer for internal documentation using **Pinecone**.
- Automated the synthesis of test cases from architectural documentation.

### R - Result
- Achieved **25% reduction** in manual test creation time.
- Improved defect detection rate by **18%** through AI-assisted RCA.
- Established a scalable blueprint for AI adoption within the integration team.

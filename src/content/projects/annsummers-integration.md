### Project Overview
During my tenure as an Integration Consultant at Solistech, I architected a unified logistics integration platform for AnnSummers, a major UK retailer.

### S - Situation
The client had fragmented integrations with multiple shipping providers, leading to data inconsistencies and shipping delays.

### T - Task
Create a canonical integration layer to unify communications with DHL, DPD, and RoyalMail, ensuring reliable data flow and custom caching for high performance.

### A - Action
- Developed **MuleSoft DevKit connectors** for specialized logistics APIs.
- Built a **Canonical Model** to standardize shipping data across all providers.
- Implemented a **Custom Caching Mechanism** to optimize API response times.
- Using **Drools** for complex decision-making in shipping logic.

### R - Result
- Streamlined international shipping operations.
- Reduced integration complexity by replacing point-to-point connections with a hub-and-spoke model.
- Successfully integrated logistics analytics with the centralized BI warehouse.
